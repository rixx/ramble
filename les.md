my first contact with les miserables was when I was eight. gavroche.
why never translated btw

1897 film
=========
1 minute: Victor Hugo et les principaux personnages des misérables, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l4H5pe4kaU
Isn't it weird how this could be a recent youtube hit, if you just added sound and smoothed over the transitions?

1905 film
=========
Le Chemineau, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg0smEpO3vE
look at the film tricks! The painted backgrounds are adorable. It's been over a hundred years and the reactions people
show to beggars have not changed, including the exact gestures. Same for sneaking. And look at the coats the gendarmes
are wearing!
Notably from a time when there was no space (in time, in brain space?) to fit the les mis twist to the story!

1925 silent film
================
Four parts, like the book. Henry Fescourt. I'm mostly busy looking at clothes, spaces, gestures. Space is a clear
indicator of wealth, and it's easier to see in things so removed. Playing with clothes and size and movement works just
the same (only the markers are different, of course). Cute children still work.

On a technical note, the tricks are interesting. Constantly showing text is meh, so sometimes there will be objects
shown to indicate conversation topics, like a guillotine while the bishop is talking to the prisoner. For all that it is
not a colour film, it plays with colour a lot. Also, there are way less subtitles/writing screens than I thought there
would be. A lot of scenes, even loadbearing ones, are mostly acted out, and it's sufficiently clear what's happening.
Aging is done very well!

Depiction of the story: I like how Valjean is shown to be an unsympathetic outsider at first, very gritty and real in
his poverty and separation from society. He's not somebody you feel sympathy for, and the actor has an excellent scowl.
Javert's hat's the same. Follows the book extremely closely, and is great at showing mental states and characters.
But also, be careful if you watch with music – it'll influence your perception.
The slowness and focus on faces makes it possible to achieve lots of emotional effects. Young Cosette going through the
woods was appropriately terrifying, no wonder they cut it in current versions.
Jauvert's considerations before his death are incredibly impressive. See last part at 1:01h

1934 film
=========

three parts. brilliant poster. Side note: The bishop is played by Henry Krauss, who played lead in the 1913 adaptation
of Les Mis.

Slow moving. No music for long stretches. BUT THE VALJEAN ACTING HOLY WOW. Also, powerpoint transitions start here.
The camera actually moves! So fancy. People have more expressions, less stagecraft. Somebody figured out the medium in
the nine years in between. Good use of music, good use of noises and camera movement, but HOLY WOW THE ACTING. Jean
Valjean realising that somebody else is given up in his stead is … so subtle.

And they included a lot of details, a lot of fine touches that work extremely well visually, and less in text. I'm
beyond impressed. Not just gestures and looks (though those, too), also camera tricks and sound inserts to show mental
agitation and the like.

More screen time for Fantine, which is excellent! Fantine looks like a vapid idiot, which is less excellent! Other
people are framed in terms of intelligence, too. Marius's grandfather is hilarious. Smol Cosette isn't terribly good,
but also not in the movie for long.
