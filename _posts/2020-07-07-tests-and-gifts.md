title: Failure: tests and gifts
---

I wrote most this post on 2020-06-27, and then avoided reading it and thinking about it for the next ten days.
Yes, it's that bad.

<blockquote>
[Cordelia said slowly] “But I’ve always thought--tests are a gift. And great tests are a great gift. To fail the test is a misfortune. But to refuse the test is to refuse the gift, and something worse, more irrevocable, than misfortune. Do you understand what I’m saying?”<br>

“No,” said Vortala.<br>

“Yes,” said Vorkosigan. […]<br>

“If you think it’s really wrong,” said Cordelia to Vorkosigan, “that’s one thing. Maybe that’s the test. But if it’s only fear of failure--you have not the right to refuse the gift for that.”<br>

“It’s an impossible job.”<br>

“That happens, sometimes.”<br>
</blockquote>

This is going to be more diary-style reflection and less finished thoughts.

*This is true:* Taking Cordelia's view on challenging situations would help me a lot.
It's not a universally useful approach, but it resonates with me and my approach to life.

*This is false:* Failing a test is worse than refusing it. Failing a test is painful in a way that refusal is
not.

*This is true:* Accepting the gift of a hard test is scary in a primal, painful way. I shy from it the way an
animal shies from fire, the way a little kid starts panicking when it thinks it's lost.

*This is false:* I cannot change how I react to such gifts.

*This is true:* Changing my reaction requires courage.

*This is false:* It won't be that bad. Do it once, get it over with.

*This is true:* The great gift consists of innumerable smaller gifts. Accepting them requires persistent attention and
courage.

*This is false:* Continuous attention and courage is impossible, imperfections are inevitable, therefore this approach
is a dead end.

*This is true:* Persistent is not the same as continuous. Courage breeds courage¹. Life is best experienced as fluidly
moving from one experience to the next.

All just because of a scifi novel that I had filed under "weak start to a brilliant series". Of course, upon finding
this quote, I re-read the whole book and found out that it's actually a strong start into a brilliant series. Here's to
accepting gifts.
