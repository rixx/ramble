I continue to be buried in work, and things have reached a stage where I wonder if I should continue posting these.
Is this <butterfly> a warning sign?

## pretalx

Talked to two serious customers, one with a long feedback list and one with a long proposal list, plus some general
support stuff.

Implemented a new exporter (this time, one for reviews) because I was about to answer a support email with "you can use
the API" and then reconsidered my life choices.

## Other tech things

I worked. That was pretty much my life.

I guess I also did the end-of-month accounting, and started hiding my OS status bar to reduce distractions. Upside: less
distractions. Downside: I lose track of time even more.
  
## Life stuff

Nothing really happened, on account of work work work (again). No geohashes this week, either, but on Saturday, I helped
my sister paint her bedroom, together with the rest of the family, which was fun.

Oh, and I streamed a bunch! I probably won't reach 100 streams this year, but it's no longer looking impossible, and
it's also kinda fun.

## Books

No book reviews, no other fun, but I read *There is no antimemetics division* (fun) and *We are satellites* (decent).
Plus a book my mother translated, which is always a cool experience.
