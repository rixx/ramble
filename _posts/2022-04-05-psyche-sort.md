## Day 2: Psyche Sort

No fancy text today, just an idea: after everything has finally been covered in surveillance AI, you can keep track of
everything. Global leaderbords for literally everything you could care to track are the result. Never stop comparing
yourself to others. Try to combine things so that you are first (or in the top 10, at least). Best at laying bricks in
rainy weather while reciting poetry? Here's your leaderboard award, congratulations. What more could you want in life.

## Day 3: Goblin Marketplace

I have nothing, I'll skip this one.

## Day 4: Kafka's Metaverse

You're in it. You can't wake up.

:)
