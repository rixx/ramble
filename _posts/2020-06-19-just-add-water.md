title: Just Add Water
---

On the surface, it's simple â€“ no pun intended: I am a wave in the ocean. I began my life when wind and ocean came
together, and maybe there was even love involved. I will wander the ocean until my death, either by exhaustion or by
finding the short. Such is life for us waves.

But, you sea, this answers **nothing**. Who am I, really? Who am I truly, deep down? What is my *purpose* in life? What
is my place in the universe, what is my contribution? Where should I go? Do I follow everybody else, or do I choose a
diverging path, as far as the currents permit me? Does it even matter? Does anything I do matter? Will anybody remember
me? I'm just a drop of water in the sea, after all.

Am I reaching my full potential? How do I become a better wave? How do I make sure I am the best I could be? Sometimes I
feel stuck on this, dead in the water. Have I come far enough for a wave my age? What are other waves my age doing? I'm
afraid they are further ahead, taller, more forceful, maybe even just better waves. Making a splash instead of going
with the flow. Some of them are immense, strong, heroic, something I can never be. Sometimes, I hate them. Then I hate
myself for being so small-minded. Yes, I know, cry me a river.

There's a whole ocean beneath us. We like to ignore it, because it is scary and unknowable and deeper than comprehension
can understand. It's death â€“ waves cannot exist in the deep. But somehow, it's also life â€“ we could not exist without
it. Some say, the Deep holds the answers. Some pray to it. Most try to forget about it. In our daily lives, it really
doesn't matter (except that it underpins everything). It makes me feel small, and irrelevant. It reminds me that the
boundary between and my fellow waves is really, uhm, fluid. In our daily lives, we speak of "I" and "you", when in truth
the separation is much less clear than we'd like to believe.

What's a wave to do?
