This is a slight rebranding of this blog.

<blockquote>All models are wrong, but some are useful.</blockquote>

[All models are wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong), some are useful, and their usefulness scales
with your understanding of *how* they are wrong. The same is not true of all opinions, granted, but of most of them.
Most useful opinions can be successfully argued with. Why?

Well, if an opinion cannot be successfully argued with, it must either be a truism (boring, useless), or so tightly
scoped that there is no room for argument. Those opinions are still useful â€“ but probably only within the scope, and
slightly beyond it. Usually the scope is "for me", but it can also be anything else. provided you have legislative or
genie-safe phrasing skills.

I don't particularly enjoy arguments that I didn't search out in the first place, and I find myself take steps to avoid
them where I can. This sort of thing is poison to creative processes, because it adds a literal internal censor to all
creative processes. So I'm hereby **declaring all opinions in this blog wrong but useful**. This is a neat hack to keep
my creativity from crumbling under minor frivolities like reason and logic.

"If I write this, I'll invite argument" is an annoying thought, but one I've learnt to work with. Sadly that doesn't
help: My inner censor has co-evolved to present lots of counter-arguments while I'm having and expressing an idea. To
keep this strategy from putting me off my writing, I'll put those counter-opinions into posts, too. Posts that refer to
each other will have "refutes"/"is refuted by" references, even if the other post isn't really a refutation.

I'm hoping for a good game of tag between "yes, and" and "no but".
