title: Weeknotes for March 7th â€“ 13th. Work work work.
---

Things are officially back to normal, with a side of busy: I spent most of the week working, and the rest with family.
Little to report, but I still enjoy the weekly check-in here.

It's a bit scary to see that a whole week passed, and very little happened because I was so buried in work.

## pretalx

Pretalx wasn't a focus this week, so there were only a handful of tiny changes: A minor issue in our GDPR agreement plus
an address update, CI improvements (auto-cancelling runs in PR if updates are pushed), and fixes to the email
placeholder display. I also finally made custom exports (where you can pick and choose fields and data, and export to
CSV or JSON) the first export choice you're presented with, prompted by a user looking for exactly this and not finding
it.

## Venueless

Last week I said "more next week, hopefully" regarding our potential new feature, but it turns out that we need more
user/customer research, so nothing yet.

## Other tech things

I spent most of the week working for a non-open-source project, so I can't tell you more than that it's in the early
project stage where I get to ask the stakeholders a ton of questions, and then some, to be sure I understand the
problem. Exhausting, but promising.

Other than that, I updated a pretix plugin due to the new pip dependency resolver, and updated some other projects and
translations. A new Python 3.11 alpha came out, so I updated the package on AUR, too. In my free time, I also improved
my medieval tracery window generator (nerrrrd) on stream and then printed some of the resulting pictures with my pen
plotter, which was very neat.

I cleaned up my shell aliases a bit, made them more resilient to running on machines without certain tools installed,
and added two new ones:

- `alias yay="sudo trickle -s -d 6000 yay"` rate limits my package manager
- `alias htop="btop"` replaces htop (which I will execute by reflex, forever) with the shiny
  [btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop)

Oh, and I installed [ublacklist](https://iorate.github.io/ublacklist/docs) in my browser, which makes it easy to remove
entire domains from Google results. Never seeing w3schools ever again whee.
  
## Life stuff

That project proposal I finished last week? Didn't get it. Sad, but I had plenty of other things to do: I took my sister
out for lunch, helped my brother with his big school project, met with friends for drinks, and spent all of the weekend
with various parts of my family.

I improved my main website a bunch, adding more visible links to my other sites, especially to
[dev.rixx.de](//dev.rixx.de).


## Books

I finally finished *Stuff Matters*, 14 days after starting it. That's how it goes when I read nonfiction, even when I
find it really interesting. As if to prove the point, it took me all of a single day to finish *Dragonflight*, that same
day. Yikes.

Also managed to get out a couple of book reviews:

- [Creatures of Light and Darkness](https://books.rixx.de/roger-zelazny/creatures-of-light-and-darkness/)
- [Eaters of the Dead](https://books.rixx.de/michael-crichton/eaters-of-the-dead/)
- [Flight of Magpies](https://books.rixx.de/k-j-charles/flight-of-magpies/)
- [The Utterly Uninteresting and Unadventurous Tales of Fred, the Vampire Accountant ](https://books.rixx.de/drew-hayes/the-utterly-uninteresting-and-unadventurous-tales-of-fred-the-vampire-accountant/)
