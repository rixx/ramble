title: Weeknotes for February 7th – February 13th. Light mode, then nothing
---

After last week, where I was feeling slow and brain-foggy (mostly due to a cold), this week I got two or three decent
days, and then I got sick so badly that I really couldn't do anything at all. I'm back to mostly functioning as of
today, unless you count the blinding headaches that won't go away. So this is a short one:

## pretalx

I added a new often-requested placeholder for emails and templates, `{all_reviews}`, allowing organisers to put reviewer
feedback into emails automatically.

A second feature is a new redirect URL, useful for generic login pages, that will put people with just a single
organiser event on that event's page, and people who submitted proposals to just a single event on their profile page
for that event. I have yet to build a page that is properly welcoming to everybody else (they currently get sent to the
organiser dashboard, which is fine for organisers, but confusing for speakers), but it's a step in the right direction.

I also fixed a handful of bugs, whenever they happened with useful stack traces: Improved the detection of overlapping
talks, created safer fallback handling of missing speaker profiles, and fixed two organiser level bugs in the event and
team creation mechanics.

## Venueless

I fixed a hold-up in one of our most important PRs right now, by bashing my head against a wall for three hours until I
found a missing ``async`` keyword.

## Other tech things

I was still upset over how unproductive I had been the week before last, and in my despair, I switched all my tools to
light mode. As this included my terminal and my editor, and various other terminal applications, this turned out to be a
one-day effort followed by occasional tinkering when I caught another contrast fail. I now know how to write vim themes,
which is probably a net positive, and I went with a fairly desaturated themes (only black plus two colours, one for
constants and one for comments), in the hopes of – I don't even know. Confusing my brain into working? Can't tell if
it's working yet, but it doesn't seem to be hurting me.
  
## Life stuff

Socialising went well: I met some people I knew only vaguely from online, which was very welcome. Pandemic mode meant we walked around the city
for hours, and I enjoyed every bit of it. There was also my sister's birthday party, a small family affair that reminded
me that I need to stock up on presents for other upcoming birthdays (I thankfully had planned ahead for this one).

## Books

I finished all of one book this week, started another, and wrote zero reviews. Book content will return at some point.

Last week, I ended on:

> All things considered, this week *sucked*. New brain, please.

Well, let me rephrase that:

**All things considered, this week *sucked*. New body, please.**
