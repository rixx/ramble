title: Weeknotes for March 13th â€“ 20th. Woork.

I continue to be buried in work, nothing much else to see here.

## pretalx

New feature: questions can have new types, "date", "datetime" and "URL". Also, file uploads size limits are now also
enforced client-side with some minimal JavaScript. Plus, organisers get markdown rendering previews on more markdown
fields, yay.

On the maintenance side of things, I fixed a bug in review assignments (that occurred when users were in multiple teams, solved by a simple `distinct()`), and released pretalx-downstream thanks to a contribution by Kunsi.

## Other tech things

Mostly worked on a client project, but there were some small other tech things:

- I found out about the ThinkPad hardware reset, which fixed my laptop's inability to use external monitors.
- Firefox hacks: added a user script for Nitter that adds a link and a copy-link button to Twitter.
- Firefox blah: Switched from DecentralEyes to LocalCDN, turned off some more telemetry settings, and some UX
  improvements: not opening the Downloads panel on every download, removing full-screen warnings and reducing download
  dialogue timeout.
- New Python PKGBUILD and also reverted last week's pip inclusion, because updates don't apply cleanly. Should fix that.
- Added an update script to my accounting tool for easier server maintenance.
- Added cool stats to the accounting stats page: Now I can see how my income compares to the same time last year,
  aggregated. Very helpful to adjust expectations regarding slow months (especially November/December).
  
## Life stuff

Nothing really happened, on account of work work work.
Ordered a good lamp for my desk, finally. Improved my mother's website, and visited a
[geohash](https://geohashing.site/geohashing/2022-03-20_52_13).


## Books

I read Canticle, while expecting Canticle for Leibowitz, so that was hilarious. Also did some further catching up on
reviews, backlog is only 9 books and some short stories now.
