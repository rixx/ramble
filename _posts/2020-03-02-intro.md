This is my rambling blog. I'll use it for writing practice, because writing is one of those annoying things you get
better at the more you do it. Like, um, everything.

Unless you're in dire need of reading material, you're probably better off elsewhere, dear reader, for example on my
[main website](https://rixx.de). There, you'll find interesting stories, technical guides, and fun experiments. Here,
you will find takes on topics I've been thinking about â€“ and that's the end of my impressive list of qualifications. Any
thought that manages to stick around in my brain for more than ten minutes will do.
