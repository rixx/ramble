title: Shards of a good life
---

*(now with fixed formatting)*

Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ἡ εἰκών<br>
But we can only see it through a glass (yes, darkly)<br>
And the glass is shattered, its shards<br>
Scattered wide when you first glanced at the whole<br>
Possibly at your birth.<br>

(And if you don't believe in original sin<br>
Well<br>
Maybe through your parents fucking you up<br>
Or getting infected with death<br>
Or with understanding<br>
Whatever)<br>

Without the shards you're just an NPC¹<br>
Drifting through, like, a decent life, y'know?<br>
Bearable. As special as the rules allow.<br>
I'm unique, yells the crowd, not quite desperate enough to despair.<br>

The shards sparkle and tempt and terrify<br>
Their boon: Knowledge and power and freedom and strength<br>
(and honour and glory and blessing?)<br>
But they like to cut you deeply when you reach for them<br>
And no mirror comes without a dark side<br>
A shadow reaching out in repellant longing<br>
And what you do now (and now. and now. and now.) forever defines your life.<br>


If it's hard, it's because it's simple.<br>
If it's hidden, it's because it's true.<br>

(or was it the other way around?)<br>
