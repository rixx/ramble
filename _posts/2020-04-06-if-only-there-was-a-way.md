Asking questions is hard. I used to be terrible at it, and I still have to use a considerable amount of energy to ask
questions in most situations. I appear to be in good company: Every day I see people who reason, guess, wonder or
complain about issues they could approach with a question. If I'm feeling very grumpy, I'll comment with "**If only
there was a way to find out.**".

Asking questions is a great tool. It gives you access to information you didn't have before, regardless of the answer
you receive. It deepens your understanding, both of the answer you receive, the person giving the answer, and yourself.
Questions are a great, honest way to build and improve relationships and friendships. And that's just for pretty average
questions: If you build up your questioning skills, you'll get deeper and better answers, which in turn allow deeper and
better questions.

So how do you get good at asking questions?  There's an active skillset to finding and asking good questions, and like
most skills, you can improve it through thoughtful practice. Good questions spring from honest curiosity. Find out what
you're missing, what's only known to others, what seems unreasonable or mysterious or obviously wrong to you – and
then accept that you're probably missing something. Making a good faith effort to improve your understanding will guide
you to possible good questions to ask. They stand opposed to pointed questions that are intended to educate, to hurt, or
to show off how knowledgeable you are¹.

Once you have candidates for good questions, try coming up with answers yourself. You may realise that you can actually
answer part of the question and that you can be more specific in what you want to know. Or you may realise that you're
not sure about some preconditions that you need to understand any answer you can be given. Getting an answer after
you've tried to guess possible answers is terribly useful. Follow-up questions will come naturally, because you have
already built a context for the answer!

So *finding* a good question requires thoughtfulness – but actually *asking* the question requires a bit of emotional
processing.

If you're like me, the biggest part is undoing past damage, because the hard part isn't to ask the best questions,
it's to [ask questions at all](https://twitter.com/ellle_em/status/1245729262839136257). If you've ever had the
experience of talking to a roughly three year old child, you'll know that most of us start out with a *tremendous*²
capacity for asking questions. Why is the sky blue? How does the train know where to go? Why don't you just print more
money? Who's the boss of you?

And then, after some time, some of us (most of us?) stop asking questions. Maybe you were given to understand that you
were [smart, and smart kids know everything already]({% post_url 2020-04-05-against-compliments %}). Maybe your
questions stumped or annoyed the others, and you learnt that people liked you better if you stayed quiet. Maybe you were
ridiculed for not knowing something. Maybe you [compared yourself to others]({% post_url 2020-03-12-compare-yourself %})
without a strong foundation in self-worth. Probably it was a combination of these and other things. It's worth your time
to figure out what is keeping you from asking questions. Chances are that it's a [legacy
emotion](https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html) that you need to reconsider.

Even if asking questions isn't this hard for you, there's a layer of emotional reasoning to it. If you ask a question,
you yield the floor and the answer you receive is out of your hands. But you still have some responsibility: You'll have
to deal with the answer. Answers can be unhelpful, unexpected, empty, hurtful, out of scope, incomprehensible. As the
person asking the question, it's your responsibility to be open to the possibility that you won't like the answer – the
more personal the question, the more important. *Do not ask questions if you're not prepared to hear the answer.*

Recap: All you need to do is find questions, imagine possible answers, overcome a predisposition not to ask questions
and then accept all kinds of answers … But then you'll unlock the power of finding out what's in other people's minds,
and that makes the effort worth it.
