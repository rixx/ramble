summary: 'What if hustle porn, but for virtues?'

<blockquote>
When you feel burning desire for something that appears pleasureful, you are like a person under a spell. Instead of acting on impulse, take a step back—wait till the enchantment fades and you can see things as they are.

<p class="source">Epictetus, The Manual</p>

Epictetus and his Manual are probably the easiest way to get a primary-source insight into stoicism. I enjoyed reading
it, both out of intellectual curiosity (primary sources are cool!) and because it says a bunch of true things. I think
stoicism, especially the parts that focus on a level of detachment and acceptance, has important things to say, even
though I'm not on board with large parts of Roman understanding of virtue and duty.

And yet.

In some ways, The Manual and similar writings feel very similar to modern productivity porn (virtue porn?). They talk
about ideal behaviour in a glorifying way that feels like it's trying to sell me on the virtuous feeling I get when I
*think* about good things. If Epictet tells me to stay silent among strangers and even among friends not to talk about
trivial matters, it feels just like when the latest productivity guide tells me that if I manage my inbox just *so*, my
life will be happy and efficient.

I think my problem boils down to this: While giving practical advice (that I don't even necessarily agree with, talking
about trivial things is good, actually), they claim that following this advice will give me the moral high ground – and
not following it is consequently bad. At least Epictetus is straightforward about this – his work is intended as an
instruction on how to lead your life in a way that is Good. Productivity gurus are less honest about this backdrop, but
it is there nonetheless. See also Mordecai's [Protestant work ethic might just not be
ethical](https://rambling.malignat.us/2020-06-10/Protestant-work-ethics-might-just-not-be-ethical.).
