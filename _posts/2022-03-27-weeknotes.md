title: Weeknotes for March 21st – 27th. So much work.
---

I continue to be buried in work, nothing much else to see here, sadly. Feels a bit odd, having nothing to say at all,
but it should be only one or two more weeks of intense work before I have free time again.

## pretalx

Fixed a bug where speaker images were displayed on event pages, even when the event had never asked for speaker images
(if the images were present from other events). Also added a missing question field, and made sure to ignore reviews of
deleted proposals in global stats.

For my own convenience, added a user manager to pretalx.com, for when people need help with their password resets and
their team management.

## Other tech things

Mostly worked on a client project. Like, a lot.

But, if you're reading this: I started a new Discord server for people who are 2 out of 3 on freelancer, web/Python dev,
German (or, you know, vaguely related), because I miss discussions with colleagues. You can join
[here](https://discord.gg/ePUq4xvQFB), and I made a super nice logo for it, considering that I'm not artsy and took all
of 15 minutes for it.
  
## Life stuff

Nothing really happened, on account of work work work.

My new desk lamp arrived and it's extremely cool, plus I got to feel clever for finding alternative mounting options
when it didn't fit my desk. I also visited a [geohash](https://geohashing.site/geohashing/2022-03-26_52_13) again. Plus,
finally some socializing: a family birthday party, a friend's birthday party, and visiting old friends just because I
was close by.

(And I finally booked flights for EMF, wheee).

## Books

No new reviews, on account of … you guessed it, work. But I finished Canticle for Leibowitz, which was pretty wow, and a
range of short stories that I enjoyed, plus the first part of the fun-and-trashy online series Beware of Chicken.
