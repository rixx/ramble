# Actionable

- [ ] Don't compliment, it's judgement and criticism in disguise. It inhibits your flow. Recognise when compliments
      block you (re "how did you do that?" in Inner Game of Tennis)
      Praise (meh, judgement, hierarchy, manipulation. lacks gratitude and respect, same as rebuke) vs encouragement:
      dank, freude, …^
      Same as intervention vs assistance
- [ ] Followup to "don't compliment": Stop judging yourself: You inhibit your zen reactions. Focus on evaluating.
- [ ] Signifiers of fullfilment: Does your work spark joy, do you want to put your name on it, in a world where everything bears names?
- [ ] You cannot lose, because you define the game. I mean, you can lose, but why'd you define a game that you can lose
      in? Game: "enjoy". Game: "improve x"
- [ ] say "hell yes" or nah
- [ ] Instead of intending to do something, think about it (/ask for it), then let it happen. Good for sports, but also other things.
      If that doesn't work, figure out which parts are either aversive or unclear. Let the X x itself.
- [ ] Communication strategies that don't account for assholes are everywhere. Same for system design and disasters. The
      1% are worth to be considered.
- [ ] Depression/anxiety can teach you a lot about project management
- [ ] narrative poisoning (aggressive dad etc)
- [ ] no decisions when you're feeling like shit, or when you're feeling great
- [ ] replacing defensiveness with curiosity (too preachy?) for social interactions. gentle/kind/respectful though.
      needs prompts, like "what's your relationship with x", We know how fresh and original is each man, even the slowest and dullest. If we come at him right, talk him along, and give him his head, and at last say, What do you want? (Or if the man is very old, What did you want?) every man will speak his dream. And when a man talks from his heart, in his moment of truth, he speaks poetry. - Ray Bradbury
      also works with yourself. don't scorn your feelings, interrogate them.
- [ ] there are no accidents, utopia
- [ ] re: there are no accidents – rule of "first time, assume accident"

# Wooo

- [ ] Read books you disagree with
- [ ] without meta communication, you lose
- [ ] We run on agreements, contracts, and mandates
- [ ] What is Focusing (cf https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1235837427282894849)
- [ ] Religion vs organised religion, fite
- [ ] Apologies
- [ ] not understanding people makes you more angry and more pessimistic, so how about you try
- [ ] Culture is intricate, and you underestimate your cultural knowledge and your cultural ignorance
- [ ] Did the church follow corporate community building practices
- [ ] Hero culture vs Granny Weatherwax
- [ ] Live with yourself, you'll have to sooner or later (lol, post-corona this sounds incredibly trite)
- [ ] conflict is good, if you go for needs & feelings instead of right or wrong
- [ ] commitment ceremonies (or ceremonies in general?)
- [ ] what to share // oversharing as a distancing measure
- [ ] vernacular defies globalism
- [ ] nothing is single-purpose
- [ ] past roles of fairytales, present alternatives
- [ ] power of magic: wand questions, maybe tarot
- [ ] write notebook posts yourself, it's good for you. find your medium of expression though (music? dance? tiktok?
      drawings?) prolific! being prolific as a means of self-transformation
- [ ] Using anki for reflection / life things | spacy spaced repetition (reviewing emotions, goals, revelations)
- [ ] memorising poems
- [ ] don't complain for a week
- [ ] "If your spouse, friend, or family member is doing something dumb but not strictly harmful, try thinking of it as their artistic expression instead of using facts and logic to fail to talk them out of it."
- [ ] understand the mindset leading to an action (hard in unexpected places)
- [ ] condescension isn't worth it (ref: narrative poisoning)

- [ ] Niceness is a really good default way to interact with people. Most people respond very well to niceness, and those who don't have revealed themselves to be your enemies.
- [ ] harsh criticism gets called “negativity,” but it isn’t. it’s hope, and it’s love. happy slappy optimism is the real negativity, because it operates under the assumption that things can’t get better. or shouldn’t.
- [ ] People's reasons are valid, even when they are bad
- [ ] Can you have enlightenment/growth w/o breakdown? consequence: triggers are good, kinda
- [ ] courage and being brave are somewhat central, maybe? you can practice courage. "I have no idea what you're talking
      about". "Sorry, really not in the mood, going home". Not downplaying excitement
- [ ] be a good teachable moment
- [ ] you can do anything for two minutes blah (-> security, deep dig efforts). And there are better ways than suffering
      heroically – usually.
- [ ] How to virtue signal
- [ ] Don't try to stop x, try to do y instead of x
- [ ] Competition
