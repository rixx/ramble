- You cannot lose, because you define the game. I mean, you can lose, but why'd you define a game that you can lose
      in? Game: "enjoy". Game: "improve x" [IGOT]
- Signifiers of fullfilment: Does your work spark joy, do you want to put your name on it, in a world where everything bears names?
      Make it trivial to do the thing, make it hard *not* to do the thing. Needs better angle.
      Find environments that *actively reward* what you want to do. [Twitter1]
      Smooth down rough edges in your daily life. ``twto`` etc.
- Don't compliment, it's judgement and criticism in disguise. It inhibits your flow. Recognise when compliments
      block you (re "how did you do that?" in Inner Game of Tennis)
      Praise (meh, judgement, hierarchy, manipulation. lacks gratitude and respect, same as rebuke) vs encouragement:
      dank, freude, …^ [IGOT]
      Same as intervention vs assistance
- say "hell yes" or nah
- Instead of intending to do something, think about it (/ask for it), then let it happen. Good for sports, but also other things.
      If that doesn't work, figure out which parts are either aversive or unclear. Let the X x itself. [IGOT] [TAO]
- Communication strategies that don't account for assholes are everywhere. Same for system design and disasters. The
      1% are worth to be considered.
- Depression/anxiety can teach you a lot about project management. Defensive life management?
- narrative poisoning (aggressive dad etc). what happens when you force narrative collapse? who would you be without
      your narrative?
- no decisions when you're feeling like shit, or when you're feeling great [ignatius, kinda, trostlosigkeit als
      abwesenheit von zen]
- replacing defensiveness with curiosity (too preachy?) for social interactions. gentle/kind/respectful though.
      needs prompts, like "what's your relationship with x", We know how fresh and original is each man, even the slowest and dullest. If we come at him right, talk him along, and give him his head, and at last say, What do you want? (Or if the man is very old, What did you want?) every man will speak his dream. And when a man talks from his heart, in his moment of truth, he speaks poetry. - Ray Bradbury
      also works with yourself. don't scorn your feelings, interrogate them.
- there are no accidents, utopia
- re: there are no accidents – rule of "first time, assume accident"
- Questions to ask when teaching: **What is the unknown?** What is required? What do you want to find? What are you
      supposed to seek? Help the student find the unknown, but also develop the student's ability to find the unknown.
      By repeating the same question, you teach the question. Problem solving is a skill: imitation and practice.

- not understanding people makes you more angry and more pessimistic, so how about you try
      people not understanding you makes them more angry and pessimistic, so make yourself understood
      People's reasons are valid, even when they are bad
      Not understanding people is also a great predictor for breakdown in friendships and relationships
      If I'm proud not to understand contrasting POVs, and people develop, I'll lose them, or they'll
      stop their development in response to my preference (this is very bad)

- can you feel your judgement conforming (e.g. read blog post, note phrases and spelling, …)
- Niceness is a really good default way to interact with people. Most people respond very well to niceness, and those who don't have revealed themselves to be your enemies.
- harsh criticism gets called “negativity,” but it isn’t. it’s hope, and it’s love. happy slappy optimism is the real negativity, because it operates under the assumption that things can’t get better. or shouldn’t.
- Can you have enlightenment/growth w/o breakdown? consequence: triggers are good, kinda
- courage and being brave are somewhat central, maybe? you can practice courage. "I have no idea what you're talking
      about". "Sorry, really not in the mood, going home". Not downplaying excitement
- be a good teachable moment
- you can do anything for two minutes blah (-> security, deep dig efforts). And there are better ways than suffering

- How to virtue signal
- Don't try to stop x, try to do y instead of x
- Competition: If you tie up your self-worth, it's meh, because you can never win. If you don't compete, you have to
      look for different drive, maybe. Or you start wanting to lose as a protective mechanism. Losing because you didn't
      really try doesn't count, after all, does it? So many late-night papers … So it *would* count if you try?
      If you shift your game away from competition entirely, that's fair – but you won't win anymore, and maybe you want
      to? I like competition, in a way. Enter: Egoless desire to win. Compete sincerely? Compete for the challenge, for
      the thing itself. Sparking joy! Run against your own time. Dein "Gegner" ist dein Freund – er ist der challenge,
      und nur durch einen guten challenge wird der Sieg bedeutsam. Er gibt dir Sinn. Wer gegen dich spielt, kooperiert
      mit dir! Ihr produziert gegenseitig die Herausforderung, die ihr zum Siegen braucht. True competition is true
      cooperation. No person is defeated, both benefit by overcoming obstacles. Hope for a good opponent!
      Second implication: Play sincerely. If you shrink back from using your advantages (provided fair game), you are a
      bad competitor and not cooperative, because your opponent can't grow. It's ok to win. "If I assume that I am
      making myself more worthy of respect by winning, then I must believe, consciously or unconsciously, that by
      defeating someone, I am making him less worthy of respect. I can’t go up without pushing someone else down. This
      belief involves us in a needless sense of guilt. It's a privilege to compete. [IGOT]

- Problem solving: Understand problem, make plan, follow plan, review result [HTSI]
- Introduce shorthands and notations as a way of learning/familiarising/ease of recall. Cf legibility. [HTSI]
- Play with constraints, cast-offs, repurposing. Sandals out of tires. Explore the adjacent possible, and expand it.
      Networking, both in ideas and people. Be receptive to the ideas of others (separate post probably). Numbers game:
      more people more ideas more prolific more success. [WGICF]
- Good ideas start out incomplete, so don't be discouraged? Find the good, refine it. Follow hunches.
      Errors are necessary to come up with god things. See inventions. Contamination drives etc. Evolution exists due to
      error rates. Exaptation! [WGICF]
- Ideas by way of collision: Go out of your way, your area, your people. Knock environments together and see what
      happens. Country < city < internet. Wide networks by way of different interests/hobbies, facilitating different
      mindsets. [WGICF]

- Calibration (Minesweeper too easy, Pinball too random, cursed game just right)
- Lessons learnt in different games
      - Minesweeper: Tell stories about anything
      - Minesweeper: Deal with arbitrariness (or play good version)
      - Pinball: what if you're missing entire layers of your current situation? You probably do, rel: culture is intricate
      - General: There are things that come easy to others that you can't do with reasonable effort. Deal, or put in
        unreasonable effort

      - Hex/Necro: Meditation in games
      - Notice if things are fun or supposed to be fun (re chocolate)
      - Watch yourself playing, and watch your mind betray you
- Register your prediction, because otherwise you'll believe your biases about yourself, and models are important
- Building a social life requires introspective awareness (know who you are, what you like), **and** social skills.
      You need to sell yourself, and to be aware what you're selling. One without the other does not work.
      One sometimes follows from the other, a bit, to a degree, and practicing in isolation isn't worth it, but it's not
      an automatic thing. [Twitter2]

- It's not a pendulum. Yes, change is reliable, but its direction isn't. your pendulum might suddenly decide to put
      in five loopings in one direction, because your frame of reference is puny, human, flawed.
- You shouldn't cut off / repress / punish parts of yourself that are unhelpful, but you can eat them (aka
      reintegrate, but more violent/visceral).

- Okay, so. Liberal arts in the trad sense are the artes liberales, the (seven-ish) free arts. And the OPPOSITE
      (thanks, Josef Pieper) are the servile arts (okay, or mechanical arts, but who are you kidding). They are
      "servile", serving, twofold-ly (hey English, you're missing words): They were accessible to lower classes and
      stands, whereas lib arts were reserved for the privileged upper classes (and clergy, to some extent!
      cf arist/aquin), but they also serve a purpose, always, pretty directly. Architecture comes with a lot of abstract
      concepts: You have to know about physics and chemistry and human nature – but you have a purpose. This was, for a
      long time, seen as inferior. More recently (you can tell it's a history buff writing when the 1850s are more
      recently) this has started to change. Industrial revolution, all that jazz. And now, with computers and silicon
      valley culture, we seem to look at flipped ____: more people see the immediately useful (HIGHLY DOUBT THAT, but
      that's popular belief) engineering studies as superior, whereas … oh the humanity. This comes with a cultural
      imperialism and rapid expansion that's not unlike the US american foreign policy: if you're the new kid on the
      block and become strong, you have the desire to shove your culture down everybody's throat. We're bringing freedom
      and democracy. We're making nerd culture mainstream.
      So, consider: There are charming and wonderful things in mechanical arts/studies/tech, and exploring them
      playfully is artsy and fulfilling and wonderful and people who are inclined towards tech should do more of that,
      less of single page web applications. **AND** more appreciation for humanities (seriously, this word.), please. If
      you're into both, the synthesis can be delightful, and we should do more of that, too. So, yeah: declaring
      tech/mechanical arts as second-best was meh, but the counter culture would profit a lot from being less arrogant
      and obnoxious, please.
