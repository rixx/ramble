      needs prompts, like "what's your relationship with x", We know how fresh and original is each man, even the slowest and dullest. If we come at him right, talk him along, and give him his head, and at last say, What do you want? (Or if the man is very old, What did you want?) every man will speak his dream. And when a man talks from his heart, in his moment of truth, he speaks poetry. - Ray Bradbury
      also works with yourself. don't scorn your feelings, interrogate them.
- [ ] no decisions when you're feeling like shit, or when you're feeling great

# Needs more thought

- [ ] consumable gifts >>> things
- [ ] memorising poems
- [ ] don't complain for a week
- [ ] "If your spouse, friend, or family member is doing something dumb but not strictly harmful, try thinking of it as their artistic expression instead of using facts and logic to fail to talk them out of it."
- [ ] understand the mindset leading to an action (hard in unexpected places)
- [ ] condescension isn't worth it
- [ ] dealing with people more clever than you
- [ ] grades vs goodhart's law
- [ ] all models are wrong, some are useful
- [ ] seeing beauty evreywhere (and hen, poof, gone)
- [ ] narrative poisoning (aggressive dad etc)
- [ ] being prolific as a means of self-transformation
- [ ] reframe what people say to how their enemies would say it
- [ ] what to do with imperfections
- [ ] can you feel your judgement conforming (e.g. read blog post, note phrases and spelling, …)
- [ ] Depression/anxiety can teach you a lot about project management
- [ ] Intelligence
- [ ] Niceness is a really good default way to interact with people. Most people respond very well to niceness, and those who don't have revealed themselves to be your enemies.
- [ ] harsh criticism gets called “negativity,” but it isn’t. it’s hope, and it’s love. happy slappy optimism is the real negativity, because it operates under the assumption that things can’t get better. or shouldn’t.
- [ ] People's reasons are valid, even when they are bad
- [ ] Praise (meh, judgement, hierarchy, manipulation. lacks gratitude and respect, same as rebuke) vs encouragement:
      dank, freude, …^
      Same as intervention vs assistance
- [ ] Can you have enlightenment/growth w/o breakdown? consequence: triggers are good, kinda
- [ ] courage and being brave are somewhat central, maybe? you can practice courage. "I have no idea what you're talking
      about". "Sorry, really not in the mood, going home". Not downplaying excitement
- [ ] say "hell yes" or nah
- [ ] be a good teachable moment
- [ ] you can do anything for two minutes blah (-> security, deep dig efforts). And there are better ways than suffering
      heroically – usually.
- [ ] Communication strategies that don't account for assholes are everywhere. Same for system design and disasters. The
      1% are worth to be considered.
